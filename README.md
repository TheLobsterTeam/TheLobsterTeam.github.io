## Description

The Lobster is 2-layer PCB prototyping solution designed to minimize the time between idea and prototype. The goal is to eliminate downtime in the design cycle, and facilitate the same fast, iterative design approach that 3D printers provide. The lobster aims to be a low friction, plug-and-play solution which turns your circuits into physical prototypes with the press of a button, and no oversight.
