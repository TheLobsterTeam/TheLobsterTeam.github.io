The term is underway, and so is our build! The frame gets built (on our kitchen counter) and the computer vision program is coming together.

<hr>

### General Updates

The team is back together in Waterloo, and we received the winter term timeline from our supervisors:

* Supervisor Meeting #1 - Jan 16-20
* Website with build log launch - Jan 27
* Digital Brochure information - Feb 3
* Supervisor Meeting #2 - Feb 13-17
* Supervisor Meeting #3 - Mar 6-10
* Mechatronics Capstone Symposium - Mar 24

Most importantly, the project should be demonstratable by March 6th, and symposium ready before March 24th!

On a logistics note, we learned that a package (containg angular contact bearings for the milling system) was lost in transit, and so we've ordered another set from China. The new parts are expected to arrive by the end of the month, and so they shouldn't interrupt our schedule.

### Mechanical Updates

Over the last week:
* The frame has been assembled
* The wire feeder has begun

##### Frame

The frame is built primarily using aluminum extrusions, which we sourced from the university's Engineering Machine Shop (EMS). We were able to purchase the aluminum cut to size, and so all we had to do was put the pieces together. To do this, we used a combination of purchased aluminum brackets and custom 3D-printed brackets.

Additionally, the frame uses two machined aluminum plates, which were previously machined over the winter holidays.

##### Wire Feeding Assembly

The wire feeding system is modeled after a 3D printer's extruder, and uses many of the same components. To save costs, and support an iterative rapid prototyping process, the assembly is mostly 3D-printed. This week the parts were printed and assembled, and the wire feeding system is now ready for offline testing and installation.

##### Mechanical Next Steps

With the frame assembled, components can now be mounted once they've been tested offline. Up first is the wire feeding assembly: we'll test that it can feed and cut wire on its own, and then mount it to the device.

After that, the via press is our next priority; the metal components have already been machined and cut as necessary, and all that's left is to 3D print the remaining components and assemble.
