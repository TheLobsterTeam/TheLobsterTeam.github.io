What's new for Week 5? The first milling head is mounted to the machine, we start to clean up our wire routing, and we take a look at dust collection.

<hr>

### General Updates

First and foremost, the bearing saga continues: we're still waiting on the additional bearings, but this hasn't significantly impacted our schedule. Functionally, the remaining two milling heads are identical to the first, and so having one assembled and mounted is sufficient for testing.

Next week is another update meeting with our supervisors (Feb 13, specifically). We plan on showing some videos of our machine's individual functionalities (movement, conductive probing, computer vision), and we'll also discuss our remaining steps before final demonstration and symposium.

### Mechanical Updates

As of last week, the only remaining actions (in terms of what we could do without the bearings) were to mount the first milling head and install limit switches, and this week, we did just that.

We also began progress on the auxiliary systems: dust managment and a full enclosre. We had previously defined these as "nice to haves," as they are not critical to the main functionality of the machine (which is to autonomously produce 2-layer PCBs), and so there's still some design work to be done before we build these systems.

##### Milling Head and Limit Switch Install

The milling head and limit switch install processes were straightforward, with the components being screwed to the frame. As with many other parts of the machine, the miling head and limit switch were designed to have flexibility in their mounting locations, and so we spent some extra time to ensure that all the components were mounted properly. This was especially important with the limit switches, as we had to ensure we had full range of motion without collisions.

##### Dust Management

In milling and drilling our PCBs, we will inevitably produce dust. We need to manage this dust for health and safety reasons, but we would also like to manage the dust so that it doesn't interfere with our various processes. For example, dust around a via hole may inhibit a proper via connection, and dust on the PCB may be thrown around when the PCB is flipped.

Our targeted solution is dust collection, in which we use some form of suction to pull dust away from the PCB. If properly implemented, this would be the most autonomous solution for managing dust, requiring no human input. A straightforward implementation is to use a commercial vacuum, which would certainly provide ample suction for the small amounts of dust we're producing. In fact, a commercial vacuum is what we use when testing our machine.

However, we are removing small amounts of material and therefore producing small amounts of dust, and so we believe a regular vacuum may be overkill. Instead, we're first investigating using a custom dust collection setup, with a blower fan and a small cyclone separator, essentially a scaled-down version of a carpenter's dust collector.

We first tested a blower fan we had on hand, but it didn't produce much suction at its rated voltage (which makes sense, because it's a cooling fan designed for air flow rather than pressure). Our next attempt will use a custom designed and 3D-printed blower fan, the design of which we'll base off of larger scale blower fans for wood dust collection.

##### Mechanical Next Steps

Our immediate priority is still to finish the remaining milling heads (dependent on the bearings arriving), with our work in the meantime focusing on dust management and the enclosure.

As always, if a mechanical concern arises in our testing, that will become our top priority.

### Electrical Updates

This week we took a look at our wire routing, to make sure we were running wires efficiently and safely. Right now, most of our wires are simply taped down as a temporary measure; once we're satisfied with all of the routing, we'll add proper sheathing, tie downs, and cable chains to tidy everything up.
