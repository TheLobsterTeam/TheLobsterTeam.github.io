We run into a minor purchasing hurdle, the first components get mounted to the frame, and the device moves off of our kitchen counter.

<hr>

### General Updates

Two weeks ago, we had to reorder some bearings that were lost in transit. This week, we received the bearings - but the seller sent the wrong size. Unfortunately, we sourced these bearings from China, which means we can't get replacements from them soon (due to Lunar New Year). Fortunately, there are alternatives (different designs, different suppliers, etc.), and we'll decide on our next steps in the coming days.

### Mechanical Updates

Last week, the wire feeder finished testing and the via press assembly process began. What did we get up to this week?

* The via press alignment was fixed
* The via press and wire feeder were installed to the frame
* The PCB flipper was assembled and installed

##### Via Press

As discussed last week, the two pressing arms were misaligned, which would prevent the device from properly forming vias. Grinding the lower arm's mounting holes worked perfectly, and the press arms are now aligned when they meet at the PCB.

With alignment verified, the via press can now be installed to the frame. Unfortunately, we can't test the pressing performance beforehand, as one of the motors is mounted on the frame due to space constraints.

##### Via Press and Wire Feeder - Installation

The via press and wire feeder were installed to the frame, using a combination of 3D-printed brackets and purchased metal brackets (much like the frame itself). A great feature of aluminum extrusion with channels is that parts can be mounted anywhere on the extrusion, allowing for fine-tuning of the components' relative locations.

While installing the press, we realized that the design works, but could be optimized for an easier install. If we need to remove the press in the future, we'll implement some changes to make maintenance and modification easier.

##### PCB Flipper

To allow the device to interact with both sides of a PCB autonomously, the device needs to rotate the PCB. Our system treats the PCB as a "book page," where the spine of the "book" is on the surface of the PCB x-y carriage. This allows the PCB to rest flat against the carriage in either operating orientation, which will help rigidity. The flipper is connected to a motor through a belt, and the motor is mounted to the PCB x-y carriage using a 3D-printed bracket. This bracket was designed to be as rigid as possible, with thick walls and lots of gussets, and the stepper mounting holes are slots to allow for adjustable belt tension.

##### From Kitchen to Living Room

The device now happily lives on our living room coffee table, and our kitchen counter can go back to being a kitchen counter.

##### Mechanical Next Steps

With two major systems installed, testing can begin once the software/firmware is ready. Additionally, we'll have to cut down our PCB stock to the right size (3" x 4"), which we can do on campus.

For the build, our next priority is the x- and y-motion systems. The rails and carriages have already been assembled as part of the frame build, but we need to fine-tune alignment and install the required motors and sensors.
