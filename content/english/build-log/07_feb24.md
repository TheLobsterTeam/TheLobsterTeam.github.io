As reading week passes and the demo date gets closer, we make more progess towards a functional machine.

<hr>

### General Updates

Reading week meant a short pause in the build, as some of our team members took time to visit family, but we're still moving towards a fully functional machine.

We have a few important milestones to prepare for in the next few weeks:
- CSA Pre-inspection (by March 3)
- CSA Inspection (the week of March 6)
- Demonstration to our Supervisors (the week of March 6)

### Mechanical Updates

This week follows a similar theme to previous weeks: more progress on milling heads, and more progess on dust management.

##### Milling Heads

The two milling/drilling heads have been installed to the machine, and now all critical mechanical sysystems are officially installed. As previously discussed, these two heads are functionally identical to the first, and so their testing and calibration are expected to go by much faster, using the results from the first head.

##### Dust Management

In previous updates we showcased a custom blower fan to use in our dust collection system; over the last week we've prototyped it, iterated on the design to increase suction, and are now in the process of prototyping the rest of the system (primarily a dust separator).

##### Mechanical Next Steps

The mechanical priority is the same as it's been for the past few weeks; solving any issues that come up during testing, and focusing on dust management and the enclosure otherwise.
