We continue to move towards demonstrating our machine (and have a few more hiccups along the way).

<hr>

### General Updates

Over the past week, we've consulted MME staff regarding safety, and are on the right track to having a safe machine for symposium. We've also confirmed that our demonstration with our supervisors is next week, on March 10th.

While testing, we also hit a slight road block - a component on our control board failed, leaving us with limited functionality. Fortunately, fast shipping from Digikey and some careful soldering let us repair the board, although we did lose a bit of testing time for some features.

### Mechanical Updates

During testing, we identified some issues with motion systems and the wire cutter, which we addressed over the past week.

##### Unobstructing Motion

In a previous update, we discussed the PCB flipping system that is part of the PCB carriage. This system is actuated and therefore requires wires running to it, and we experienced some interference with these wires and other components. While the wires had enough length to allow for full movement, they would occasionally catch on other components, which could be damaging.

To address this issue, we decided to implement cable drag chains to protect the wire and constrain their movement. To save money, we chose to 3D print the cable chains, and to ensure a perfect fit, we designed them for our specific application.

##### Cutter Replacement Parts

In our Week 6 update, we discussed replacing the wire snippers used in the cutter, due to a damaged and dull blade. The new wire snippers work well and have remained sharp, but they have a slightly different geometry compared to the older cutters. While the wire cutter system still worked with the new cutter, there was some interference between parts that would eventually cause failure.

As a preventative measure, we designed a new servo motor holder to better position the servo, and implemented a new wire snipper connector to match.
