The long-awaited bearings arrive, our wiring gets slightly messier, and we run into our first problem while testing.

<hr>

### General Updates

After a long wait and some hiccups, we've finally received the bearings for the remaining two milling/drilling heads! Better yet, the bearings are the right size and quantity.

This past week, we also had our second meeting with our supervisors, where we presented our current progress and our plan for preparing for final demonstration.

### Mechanical Updates

Last week, we finished up the first milling/drilling head and started take a look at dust management. This week is more of the same: with the bearings in our possession, we built the remaining two milling heads, and we continued designing our own suction fan.

We also discovered during testing that our wire cutter was starting to dull, leading to poor cuts, and we addressed that as soon as it came up.

##### Milling Heads

The remaining two milling/drilling heads are functionally identical to the first, although they have some improvements based on the first milling head. Most noticeably, the limit switch contact arm is now removeable, so we can adjust the z-home position of the head as necessary (and as a bonus, we get a higher quality 3D-print by separating the contact arm into a new component). There were also some quality-of-life changes, such as a cutout for the spindle motor's wiring.

##### Dust Management

As discussed last week, we're currentling exploring designing our own fan to produce suction for dust collection. As of this week we have a preliminary design for a fan which will be powered by a brushless DC motor; up next is to 3D-print the fan components and test it.

##### Staying Sharp

In testing our machine, we realized that the via wire cutter's blades were beginning to dull, leading to wire being bent instead of cut. For us, the simplest solution was to purchase a new cutter; while the last cutter was a generic 170-type wire cutter, our new cutter is a Weller branded model which we hope will have more longevity.

##### Mechanical Next Steps

With the critical systems built, our immediate mechanical priority is again focusing on dust management and the enclosure.

As always, if a mechanical concern arises in our testing, that will become our top priority.
