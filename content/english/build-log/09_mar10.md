A few minor updates are made to the machine, testing continues, and we run into some issues with our demo.

<hr>

### General Updates

In the last few updates, we've discussed having a demonstration with our supervisors. This demonstration happened on March 9th, but unfortunately it did not go as planned.

Due to unforeseen issues with the open-source firmware we're using as a base (Klipper), we've had to produce more original code than we expected. As such, while we were able to implement all invidiual features by March 9th, we were unable to have a fully integrated system running at the time.

Worse yet, we ran into networking issues that prevented us from demonstrating the machine on campus. The machine is controlled through a web-interface, requiring both the controller and our computer to be on the same network, and the controller was unable to connect to both the school's wifi and our own hotspots at the time of our demo. Working on a fix is our highest priority (we're investigating using a direct ethernet connection), so that we can properly control and demonstrate the machine during the Capstone Symposium on March 24th.

Despite these setbacks, we're still on the right track and we're excited for the symposium!

### Mechanical Updates

As with previous updates, some parts have failed during testing and they were swiftly replaced. We've also finalized and installed the dust collection system, making both the final product and our testing process a little bit cleaner.

##### The Replacements
While running various tests on the machine, a wiring mistake with our spindle motor controllers led to them overheating. While the controllers themselves are fine, their 3D-printeed mounting brackets have warped, which in turn caused some interference with the rest of the spindle. These parts have been replaced with slightly redesigned components, which should not interfere with other components even if mildly warped.

##### Dust Collection
After more testing of our custom vacuum fan, we've settled on a design that's a good compromise between performance and noise level, while also not overworking the motor we're using. The full dust collection system, which includes the fan, a cyclone separator, and a vacuum hose, have been installed on the machine.

Unfortunately, due to material and budget constraints, we only have one vacuum with one hose. To make the most of only one point of suction, we've position it next to the spindle that produces via holes, as it is critical that these holes are contaminant-free when the vias are installed.
